            Since its inception in 2001, FootPrints has been rendering a
            platform to technical minds all over the country. From paper
            presentations to mind tickling workshops, FootPrints has got it all
            for engineering students all over. Since last few years, as an
            addition to our knowledge-providing saga, we have been organising
            "School Events", aiming to enrich India's young talent with
            technical brilliance.

            FootPrintsX7 witnessed a workshop on Hands-on Learning and Robotics
            based on World-renowned LEGO Education System. There was also a

            In 2018 also, "School Events" succeeded in widening the horizons of
            students in all technical respects. It not only challenged the
            technical aspects of young school minds but also enhanced them. The
            School Students had a bountiful of scope to think in their own way
            and make a difference. FootPrintsX8 witnessed a workshop of making
            Robocars by Innovative brain academy IBA-robocar in which the
            participants learnt the basics of making a Robocar. We had another
            workshop by Vansh hobby center- glass painting where the students
            learnt basics of glass painting.
